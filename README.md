# CircuitPy Bitmap Frame Animator
Display Bitmap Animations on the S2 Nugget in CircuitPython


## How to use:

* Install CircuitPython on your S2 Nugget
* Download the .ZIP file from this repo and open it
* Drag and drop the code.py file onto your board
* Drag and drop the /lib folder onto your board
* Create or drag the folder called "frames" onto your board

Once you do this, the default animation should start to play automatically.

To test a new animation, delete the .BMP files in the /frames folder. Replace them with the .BMP files you want to test

To change the delay between frames, you can change the defaultDelay variable (default is 0 seconds)

To make sure they run in the right order, name the frames of your animation sequencially (like 1.bmp, 2.bmp)
